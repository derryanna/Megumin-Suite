/**
 * Which chain-of-thought an engine is written for.
 *
 * This mapping used to be an inline if/else chain inside the PRESETS tab's
 * click handler, which made it invisible to anything else that needed the same
 * answer -- and Dev Mode needs it, to fill in a clone's reasoning script. Two
 * copies of a mapping like this drift the moment a generation is added.
 *
 * The language argument only matters for the generations that were translated;
 * v7, v8 and v10 exist in English alone, so they ignore it. That asymmetry is
 * carried over from the original chain rather than tidied, because the CoT
 * files really are shaped that way.
